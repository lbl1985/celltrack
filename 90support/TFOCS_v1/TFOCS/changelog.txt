March 20 2011, v1.0c
    An almost comprehensive lists of changes since December:
    New:
        solver_TraceLS.m    
        solver_sLP.m        Linear Program solver
        solver_sSDP.m       Semi-Definite Program solver
        solver_sLMI.m       Linear Matrix Inequality solver
        prox_hinge.m        Proximity fcn for hinge-loss
        prox_hingeDual.m    Proximity fcn for dual of hinge-loss
        proj_0.m            Projection onto zero. Added for completeness.
        smooth_huber.m      Huber function
        smooth_logLLogistic.m   Log-likelihood of the logistic function
        smooth_logLPoisson.m    Log-likelihood of independent Poisson r.v.

        The continuation feature is now builtin to tfocs_SCD.m

    Updated and/or bug fixes:
        linop_subsample.m   -- can now handle matrix entry sampling
        proj_l2.m   -- bug fix
        prox_l1.m   -- allow scaling "q" to be a non-negative vector
        proj_box.m  -- bug fix
        private/tfocs_initialize.m  -- bug fixes
        private/tfocs_iterate.m     -- bug fixes

        smallscale/examples: the .mat files have been moved to a separate
            directory
        smooth_quad.m   -- allows nonsmooth usage too now
        solver_L1RS.m   -- bug fix (typo)
        linop_test.m    -- now compatible with multidemensional arrays

    New demos:
        smallscale/example_LinearProgram.m  linear programming
        smallscale/example_SDP.m        semi-definite programming
        smallscale/example_LMI.m        linear matrix inequality
        largescale/image_denosing_withSPOT.m

    User guide:
        Updated to mention the new routines
        Describes scaling issues
        Describes continuation
        Added acknowledgements section

    Misc:
        Thanks to Graham Coleman for bug-fixes related to multidimensional
        arrays
